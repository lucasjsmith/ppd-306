			<h1>SketchUp</h1>
			<p>Studies show that cars spend around 95% of the time parked, and we devote a lot of urban space to parking. This is something that carsharing has the direct potential to change.</p>
			<p>As a demonstration, I modeled the conditions at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Torrance+Promenade/@33.8534536,-118.3526775,750m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc6a2df51e50b8db2">Torrance Promenade</a> strip mall, which is within car2go's LA service area, as it currently stands (a lot of surface parking), and in a hypothetical carsharing utopia, with 80% less parking. The reclaimed space is shown as potential park space and room for additional mixed-use development.</p>

			<p>Currently, this development is an SOV-oriented stripmall, with nearly 1600 parking spaces.</p>
			<p>With only 20% of that many parking spaces (half of that designated for carsharing here), a great deal of usable land is opened up. For example, this could be used for new mixed use development and park/recreation space.</p>
