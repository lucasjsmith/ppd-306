			<h1>Table</h1>
			<p>With this table, I attempt to answer the question of who the users of car2go are. By analyzing the demographics of the U.S. cities in which car2go operates, a clear pattern emerges. Most of car2go cities have populations of around 600,000 people, with higher-than-average levels of education and a lower-than-average age.</p>

			<p class="notes">Notes: Demographic information based on whole cities, though Car2Go typically only operates in part of a given city, typically the densest areas around downtown. Car2Go also operates in a small portion of Los Angeles County; due to dissimilarities between Car2Go boundaries and city boundaries in this area, it was omitted from the table. Median age and median income for Minneapolis-St. Paul shown here are means of the two citiesâ€™ medians.</p>
			<p class="notes">Sources: 
			Population: 2012 Census estimates retrieved through Wolfram Alpha.
			Median age, median income, educational attainment: 2008-2012 American Communities Survey 5-Year Estimates retrieved through Wolfram Alpha.
			Car access: 2008-2012 American Communities Survey 5-Year Estimates, table B08203.
			Number of Car2Go Vehicles: Estimates based on number of cars available for hire in each location based on periodic checks of car2go.com booking page.
